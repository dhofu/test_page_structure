## Information
This is a silly page for me figure out basic interal linking. Ideally, little clickable footnotes that jump around the page.

## More Information
In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. 
The shape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw, varies in a highly remarkable manner. 
The number of the caudal and sacral vertebræ vary; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes. 
The size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. 
The proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body; the relative length of leg and of the feet; the number of scutellæ on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of structure which are variable.

## Have you considered...?
My dear Lady Lovelace
Mr. Frend’s death (which took place on Sunday Morning)
has made me answer your letter later than I should otherwise have
done. The family are all well, and have looked forward to this termination
for some time. My wife will answer your letter on a part of this.
Number and Magn
. pp. 75, 76. The use of this theorem is shown in what follows.
It proves that any quantity which lies between two others is either one of a
set of mean proportionals between those two, or as near to one as we please.
It is not self evident that the base of Napiers system, as given by himself
is ε or 1 + 1 + 1
2 + · · · as we learn from the modern mode of presenting the
theory. The last sentence in the book (making V a linear unit) would show
that Napier’s notion was to take k in such a manner that x shall
expound [?] 1 + x [‘without’ crossed out] or rather that the smaller x is the more nearly
shall
x expound 1 + x. If this were accurately done
